# Social Media App For Georgia Tech Students

Techedia is a fullstack responsive web application that can be used by any student at Georgia Tech!

For This Project I used the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

Some Features the app includes:
    User Authentication
    Users can Post anything they want to the public, including pictures
    File upload
    Users can like each others posts as well as friend each other
    Users have the option between using Light Mode and Dark Mode 

For any questions about this web application please email me at umarm417@gmail.com or umanzoor3@gatech.edu - I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you may have!
